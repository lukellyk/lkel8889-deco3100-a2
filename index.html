                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Since 1990,  Australia has been a participant in a multitude of conflicts overseas with many still ongoing. These wars have shaped and changed religions, races, governments, borders and even entire countries. This analysis aims to visualise the impacts of these conflicts on the future generation of these countries with regard to the Child Mortality Rates (CMR) as well as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index#how-is-the-human-development-index-calculated" target="_blank" class="link" style="font-family: p22-mackinac-pro, serif;">Human Development Index</a> (HDI) developed by the UN.</p>

                <p>
                    The exact origin of the Gulf War is highly debated but it is generally attributed to ‘geopolitical problems, border disputes, tribal rivalries, uneven economic growth, and lack of social and political reforms within the Persian Gulf nations’ (Schubert, 1995). With the collapse of empires as old as time such as that of the Ottomans and also the discovery of oil in the Gulf, power struggles broke out to control the immense amount of resources between some of the at least 12 new political entities that emerged post WWI and the Allied Forces, bringing the USA and subsequently, Australia, into the mix. <br><br>Unfortunately, due to the timeliness of the data it is hard to determine the precedent set in <b>Kuwait</b> before the year long war against Iraq broke out but it can be observed that the only the Human Development Index was seen to be affected, likely due to the huge impact war can have on the destruction or control of key societal aspects such as hospitals, roads and other important infrastructure. <br><br>Predictions show that if trends stay as they are for the foreseeable future, Kuwait will continue prospering as a nation and Child Mortality Rates will remain on the decline.
